# Port Scanner Python Script
This is a simple port scanner script written in python.

To use you must have Python 3.x installed on the machine.

The purpose of this script is to check if there are any open ports given an ip address.

Perfect for knowing which ports are open on a local machine to close possible vulnerabilities.

Useful for CTF challenges to find out which ports are open as a possible attack vector on a vulnerable machine.

Run the program and it will ask for the ip address. It will run a search on all ports from 1 to 1023 as those are the well-known ports.

All open ports will be printed to the console.
